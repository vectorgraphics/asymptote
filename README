Asymptote is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language for technical
drawing, inspired by MetaPost but with an improved C++-like
syntax. Asymptote provides for figures the same high-quality level of
typesetting that LaTeX does for scientific text.

Installation instructions, documentation, binaries, and source code are
available at:

https://asymptote.sourceforge.io
